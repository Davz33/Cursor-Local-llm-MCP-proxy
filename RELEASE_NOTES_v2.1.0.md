# Release Notes v2.1.0 - Tool Calling Architecture Fix

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Tool Calling Discrepancy Resolution
- **Fixed**: Discrepancy between reported tool usage and actual LLM tool calls
- **Root Cause**: LLM was simulating tool usage with inline `<thought>` tags instead of making actual API tool calls
- **Solution**: Enhanced system prompt with explicit instructions for proper tool calling format

### Multi-Turn Tool Calling Support
- **Added**: Proper support for LM Studio's multi-turn tool calling pattern
- **Improved**: Tool call reporting to distinguish between selected vs actually used tools
- **Enhanced**: Debug logging for better tool calling visibility

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Orchestrator Service
- **Enhanced**: System prompt to prevent inline tool simulation
- **Added**: Clear distinction between "Tools Selected by Orchestrator" vs "Tools Actually Called"
- **Improved**: Tool call validation and execution flow

### MCP Server
- **Updated**: Delegation info reporting for better transparency
- **Added**: Debug logging for tool call details
- **Enhanced**: Error handling for tool execution failures

## üìö Documentation Updates

### MCP Orchestrator README
- **Added**: Comprehensive tool calling behavior documentation
- **Included**: Multi-turn tool calling pattern explanation
- **Added**: Troubleshooting guide for tool calling issues
- **Documented**: Tool call reporting metrics and their meanings

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Tool Calling Verification
- **Verified**: Sequential thinking tool properly calls MCP server
- **Confirmed**: Multi-turn conversation pattern works correctly
- **Validated**: Tool execution results are properly incorporated

### Log Analysis
- **Improved**: LM Studio log analysis shows proper tool call progression
- **Enhanced**: Debug visibility into tool selection and execution phases

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Tool Execution
- **Optimized**: Tool calling pipeline for better reliability
- **Reduced**: False positive tool usage reporting
- **Improved**: Tool selection accuracy based on query analysis

## üîç Debugging & Monitoring

### Enhanced Logging
- **Added**: Detailed tool call progression logging
- **Improved**: Error reporting for tool execution failures
- **Enhanced**: Visibility into orchestrator decision-making process

### Tool Call Reporting
- **Clarified**: Distinction between different tool usage metrics
- **Added**: Clear reporting of tool selection vs execution
- **Improved**: Debug information for troubleshooting

## üìã Migration Notes

### Configuration Changes
- No breaking changes to existing configuration
- Enhanced system prompts are automatically applied
- Improved tool call reporting is backward compatible

### Behavior Changes
- Tool calling now follows proper API patterns instead of text simulation
- Multi-turn conversations are properly handled
- Tool usage reporting is more accurate and detailed

## üéØ Impact

This release resolves the critical issue where the system was reporting tool usage that wasn't actually happening, providing users with accurate visibility into tool execution and improving the overall reliability of the tool calling system.

The fix ensures that when tools are reported as "used", they are actually being called and executed through the proper MCP protocol, not just simulated in the LLM's text response.
